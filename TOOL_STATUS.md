# Tool Development Status

This document tracks the refactoring and development status of each tool component. **Always check this before modifying tool code** to avoid conflicts with ongoing refactoring efforts.

## Status Legend
- 🟢 **Done** - Tool fully refactored, uses Carbon Design System, follows all guidelines
- 🟡 **In Progress** - Tool is being refactored, use caution before modifying
- 🔴 **Not Started** - Tool uses legacy patterns, needs full refactoring

## Refactoring Checklist

When refactoring a tool, ensure:

- [ ] Uses **Carbon Design System** components (`@carbon/react`)
- [ ] All colors use `var(--cds-*)` tokens, no hardcoded hex values
- [ ] Implements **useReducer** for state management (not multiple useState hooks)
- [ ] Uses **useCallback** for memoized functions
- [ ] Follows **DRY principle** - no duplicated components/logic
- [ ] Has proper **ToolHeader** with title and description
- [ ] Input/Output panes are symmetrical and use **Carbon TextArea**
- [ ] All buttons properly spaced (gap: 1rem)
- [ ] Copy buttons present on all output/data panes
- [ ] Monospace font for data (`'IBM Plex Mono', monospace`)
- [ ] Proper flex layout for responsive sizing
- [ ] No unused imports or variables
- [ ] Code compiles without errors or warnings

## How to Update This File

When starting work on a tool:
1. Change status from 🔴 to 🟡 and add your name/timestamp
2. Add specific notes about what you're refactoring
3. When complete, change to 🟢 and add completion date

Example:
```
| YourTool | 🟡 In Progress | Refactoring state management, DRY components | Started 2025-12-13 |
```
